After the time is up, everyone's rap is displayed and played with text-to-speech, using the [Responsive Voice API](https://responsivevoice.org/). After each round, all players will vote on the rap they thought was the most clever or funny. And that's mostly it! This repeats for a number of rounds, and the player with the most points at the end is deemed the winner.
